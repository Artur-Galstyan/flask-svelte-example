# Svelte + Flask

## INFO

This project took HEAVY inspiration from this repository

[svelte-flask-example](https://github.com/cabreraalex/svelte-flask-example)

This project is simply the updated version.

## Getting Started

To get started, install `flask`:

```
pip install flask
```

Then, `cd` into the client directory and run `npm i`.

Then run the flask server with:

```
python3 main.py
```

And also run the auto build command to rebuild, if your `App.svelte` file changes:

```
npm run autobuild
```
